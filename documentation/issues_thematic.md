2017 November: Lori notes

NY Category: "organisms of uncertain taxonomy"
    Contained only two entries:
        Pneumocystis
        Pneumocystis carinii (aka P. jiroveci)
    Moved to NQ category, "fungi".

    Example of a category without any entries in GACS, not needed for current
    GACS terms.  The two entries we had were moved to fungi based on current
    knowledge of this species.

Categories not used or with few terms:
    SW vermiculture
    WQ arts  
    WS history
    WY philosophy and ethics
    LU evolution 
    LX natural history 
    NY organisms of uncertain taxonomy

Insulating materials 
* http://id.agrisemantics.org/gacs/G_TL - retained  ("materials")
* http://id.agrisemantics.org/gacs/G_CC - removed ("common terms")

Also in work, we allowed double category assignment when it made sense.  Here
are two examples were double category is used for one GACS concept.

QC of category work

    Double category assignment â€“ 

        plant protection equipment
        "TN=equipment" 
        "PR=health protection"

        milking machines 
        "TN=equipment" 
        "SS=animal production"
