### Issues on Labels

* This section could provide more specific guidance and "best practices" (with
  examples)
    * the form of labels (American/British spelling, capitalization, singular
      and plural, abbrevations and acronyms, organizational names, direct form,
      Greek letters and symbols, possessive forms, hyphenation) 
    * qualified labels (to disambiguate homographs)
    * use of scientific versus common names
    * selection of labels: literary warrant, semantic factoring of complex
      concepts, part of speech

* "All labels (either preferred or alternative) in one language (or designated
  as scientific name) are unique strings."
    * Osma: This is a bit unclear - unique in what scope? Labels of one
      concept, all labels within GACS, something else? What about labels that
      differ only by letter case? Does it mean that it is forbidden to have
      "lime"@en as an altLabel both for concepts A and B? If that is the
      intent, I suggest formulating that as a more explicit rule. Also since in
      practice this is not the case for any language currently, need to define
      what is a MUST and what is a SHOULD.

* Some issues from other thesaurus guidelines that may or may not be relevant
  to GACS: precoordination
