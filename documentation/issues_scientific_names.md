#### Issues

* Possibly move common names with no relationship to scientific names away from
  Plantae (they make the hierarchy messy).  AGROVOC and NALT are split between
  "plants (botany)" and "Plantae"; CABI lumps them.
* Cases where scientific name is transcribed into a non-Latin script.
* Including common and scientific names in a single hierarchy.
* Abbreviations.
