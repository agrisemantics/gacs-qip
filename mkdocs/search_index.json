In GACS, definitions are \"nice to have\", but\nsemantic relations are essential.  To be maintainable with consistency, on the\nother hand, semantic relations should be as simple and obvious as possible.\n\n\nBroader, narrower, and related concepts\n\n\nGACS concepts are linked among themselves with \nrelated\n, \nbroader\n, and\n\nnarrower\n relations as defined in SKOS, which are themselves based on standard\nthesaurus relations (\nRT\n, \nBT\n, and \nNT\n).  \nBroader\n and \nnarrower\n do not\nformally distinguish between \"is a\" and \"part of\" relations. In GACS, \nbroader\n\nand \nnarrower\n are generally intended to imply general-to-specific \"is a\"\nrelations, though not in a formally strict ontological sense, and there are\nplenty of exceptions (for example,\n\nMaryland\n,\nwhich is \"part of\" the \nNorth Eastern States\n(USA)\n).\n\n\nTop-level concepts\n\n\nAll concepts in GACS are grouped under three concepts that have no broader\nconcepts (top-level concepts): \n\n\n\n\nObjects\n: material things that can be seen, touched, visited (locations),\n  including conceptual objects such as ideas and models.\n\n\nEvents and actions\n: things that happen, such as processes or phenomena.\n\n\nProperties\n: attributes, characteristics, or qualities of things.\n\n\n\n\nIn thesaurus practice, top concepts are typically intended for use in faceted\nbrowsing or in creating microthesauri.  In GACS, the top concepts can be used\nas entry points for browsing GACS by thematic group, using the Hierarchy tab of\nthe Skosmos browser.  The top concepts are too abstract to be used for\nindexing.  Concepts further down in the hierarchy are more concrete and more\nuseful both for indexing and for clarifying meanings (disambiguation).  While a\ncertain amount of polyhierarchy (as when concepts have more than one broader\nconcept) may be inevitable, even desirable, it seems unrealistic to expect that\nprinciples for polyhierarchy could be applied uniformly, consistently, and at\nscale.  For GACS, the goal is to to keep the hierarchy simple, and as close to\nthe ideal of cascading \"is a\" relations, as can pragmatically be achieved.\n\n\nConcept types\n\n\nDifferentiating between types of concept can help clarify the meaning of\nconcepts across the hierarchy.  While top concepts, with their hierarchies,\nmight in principle be used to group concepts by the type of thing they\nrepresent, such as \"organisms\", the GACS hierarchy does not follow the\nprinciple of general-to-specific (hyponymy) strictly enough to ensure that \"is\na\" (\"type of\") relations always hold; the hierarchy also contains \"part of\"\n(meronym) relations.  The GACS Working Group opted to explore the usefulness of\nconcept types by creating types of SKOS concept for just four particularly\nobvious and clearly defined types of things: \nChemical\n, \nGeographical\n,\n\nOrganism\n, and \nProduct\n, with \nTopic\n as a fifth \"catch-all\" type for all\nconcepts not otherwise covered (and with the expectation that \nTopic\n might be\nfurther differentiated over time).\n\n\nCustom relations between concepts\n\n\nSome thesauri, such as AGROVOC and CAB Thesaurus, use semantic relations beyond\nthose of \nbroader\n, \nnarrower\n, and \nrelated\n to express more specific\nrelations between concepts.  However, efforts to \"ontologize\" thesauri with\nsuch additional relations struggle to ensure that the properties would be\napplied consistently, comprehensively, and maintainably.  The GACS Working\nGroup decided that custom relations should only be created for use cases\nimportant enough to justify the effort.  Two properties qualified: \nhasProduct\n\nand \nproductOf\n, for relating fish as a product to fish as an organism.\n\n\nMapping relations between concepts\n\n\nGACS was created at the intersection of three existing thesauri, and each\nconcept in GACS has a SKOS \"exact match\" relation back to the concept or\nconcepts in AGROVOC, CABT, and NALT from which it was created.  \n\n\nIn addition, the 540 concepts of type \nGeographical\n have SKOS \"close match\"\nrelations to entities in Wikidata.  These mappings facilitate access from GACS\nto Wikidata information about geographic places (such as coordinates,\npopulation, language, and religions); to Wikidata mappings out to other\ngeo-oriented vocabularies such as GeoNames and OpenStreetMap; and to mappings\nout to library-oriented authority files such as the Library of Congress Name\nAuthority File, GND (German union authority), BNF, VIAF and ISNI. As an\nexample, see the Wikidata entry for\n\nAlberta\n) and the corresponding \nGACS\nconcept\n.\n\n\nThis exercise suggests a model by which GACS might, in the future, devolve or\ndelegate responsibility for specific types of GACS concepts to external\nauthorities.  Geographic places are an obvious candidate for delegation because\nthey are not specific to agriculture and because they have been given URIs in\nso many other sources.  Once mapped to a external source, a given set of GACS\nconcepts could be reduced to a set of URIs clearly marked as dependent on the\nexternal URIs, and the GACS community could promote the use of the external\nURIs.  GACS concepts cannot simply be deleted because their URIs must be\ncredibly persistent, in accordance with explicit policies, if GACS itself is to\nbe credibly deployable.  On the other hand, the GACS URIs also provide a\nfallback option should the external authority ever cease operation, a\ncontingency that would be prudent to anticipate by policy.",

This exercise suggests a model by which GACS might, in the future, devolve or\ndelegate responsibility for specific types of GACS concepts to external\nauthorities.  Geographic places are an obvious candidate for delegation because\nthey are not specific to agriculture and because they have been given URIs in\nso many other sources.  Once mapped to a external source, a given set of GACS\nconcepts could be reduced to a set of URIs clearly marked as dependent on the\nexternal URIs, and the GACS community could promote the use of the external\nURIs.  GACS concepts cannot simply be deleted because their URIs must be\ncredibly persistent, in accordance with explicit policies, if GACS itself is to\nbe credibly deployable.  On the other hand, the GACS URIs also provide a\nfallback option should the external authority ever cease operation, a\ncontingency that would be prudent to anticipate by policy.",

            "text": "Purpose of GACS thematic classification\n\n\nMany thesauri, such as NALT, the General Finnish Ontology (YSO), UNESCO\nThesaurus, and the STW Thesaurus for Economics (Germany) provide a thematic\ndivision of concepts into clusters orthogonal to the hierarchy of broader and\nnarrower concepts.  Thematic groups allow users to view concepts by subject\narea or discipline and present specialists with concepts of interest in their \nfields.\n\n\nIn creating GACS, the GACS Working Group was able to re-use a classification\nscheme that had been developed by CABI, FAO, and NAL in the 1990s for a joint\nproject, the Unified Agriculture Thesaurus (UAT).  The CAB Classified Thesaurus\npublished in 1999 (and subsequently dropped) was found to cover over 80% of the\nconcepts in GACS.  The hierarchical, multi-level classification was adapted for\nGACS and the remaining 20% of concepts were assigned to categories.  The\nclassification scheme, documented below, is specific to GACS and may be \npruned or expanded in accordance with GACS requirements.\n\n\nUpper classification scheme for GACS (top level)\n\n\nGroups in the upper classification are designed with two-letter codes:\n\n\n    Code    Classification Heading \n    CA      GENERAL \n    FA      PHYSICAL SCIENCES \n    JA      EARTH SCIENCES \n    LA      LIFE SCIENCES \n    PA      APPLIED SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY \n    WA      SOCIAL SCIENCES AND HUMANITIES\n\n\n\nEach concept in GACS is assigned at least one category.  The classification is\nnot strict, and terms can be placed in more than one category.  In general, the\ncodes for the upper classification are not used since a more specific code is\napplied.\n\n\nExample: Concept \nforestry equipment\n may be in two categories:\n\n\n    SR      Forestry\n    TN      Equipment\n\n\n\nThe purpose of this document is to give guiding Scope Notes for each category\nto future maintainers of the GACS vocabulary.  As this work evolves, the\ndocumentation can be updated to reflect current opinion and guidance.

Thematic groups allow users to view concepts by subject\narea or discipline and present specialists with concepts of interest in their \nfields.  In creating GACS, the GACS Working Group was able to re-use a classification\nscheme that had been developed by CABI, FAO, and NAL in the 1990s for a joint\nproject, the Unified Agriculture Thesaurus (UAT).  The CAB Classified Thesaurus\npublished in 1999 (and subsequently dropped) was found to cover over 80% of the\nconcepts in GACS.  The hierarchical, multi-level classification was adapted for\nGACS and the remaining 20% of concepts were assigned to categories.
