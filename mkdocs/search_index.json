The goal of the GACS project is to create a Global Agricultural Concept Scheme as a hub for thesauri in the agricultural field, in multiple languages, for use in Linked Data.

Phase Two: GACS Beta\nThe creation and refinement of a new concept scheme mapped to and from a selection of circa 10,000 frequently used concepts from AGROVOC, CABT, and NALT.  Phase Three: GACS 1.0 and beyond\nIf resources are available for building GACS into more than the circa 10,000 concepts of GACS Beta, the GACS editorial team will develop an integrated semantic super-structure for the concept scheme, collaborate with concept providers on naming things like species, viruses, and chemicals with Linked Data URIs, and extend the GACS partnership to additional organizations and partner thesauri.\nThe process began in March 2014 with the formation of a joint GACS Working\nGroup.

There is no requirement\n   that a concept have a definition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA definition must be consistent with the position of a concept in the \n   hierarchy of concepts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA definition differs from a scope note, which focuses on what differentiates\n   the concept in question from other concepts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA concept may have one or more definitions, and each definition may be\n   expressed in one or more languages.   Additional definitions need only be\n   corrected or removed if they are in conflict with each other or with the\n   hierarchy.  (In GACS 4.0, many concepts have two or three definitions\n   inherited from AGROVOC, CABT, and NALT.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA definition consists of a narrative explanation -- the actual definition --\n   plus a mandatory indication of source.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEditors of GACS are encouraged to paraphrase from available sources \n   in writing definitions, taking care not to re-use exact wordings unless\n   the words in question are in the public domain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere a definition has been written by a GACS editor, the most salient\n   source of inspiration for the definition should be cited, where applicable,\n   or by default the source cited should be \"GACS Editors\".  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nA definition may be quoted from a source in the public domain.  Only in \n   rare cases, at the discretion of a GACS editor, should a definition be \n   quoted from a copyrighted source.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA definition should be stated as clearly and objectively as possible \n   without erroneously limiting the concept to a specific discipline.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor definitions inherited from AGROVOC, NALT, or CABT, the original \n    indication of source in AGROVOC, NALT, or CABT, are retained in \n    GACS.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinitions inherited from AGROVOC, NALT, or CABT that lack such an\n    indication of source will be assigned a default source of \"AGROVOC \n    Editors\", \"NALT Editors\", or \"CABT Editors\".

Such citations should supply enough information to identify\n    the version or edition of a source without ambiguity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe source of a definition may be indicated in the form of a URI which,\n    in the judgement of the GACS editor, is likely to remain stable over time.\n    A URI should not, for example, point to a Web search box or rely on the \n    resolution of an embedded database query.",

Preferred terms can be used as tags\nfor subject indexing (as \"descriptors\").  The precision of term-based indexing\ndepends on the uniqueness of the strings used to encode the terms. In\nproduction environments, for example when thesauri are used in complex\nworkflows, it is important that preferred terms also remain stable. \n\n\nTerms other than preferred terms are non-preferred, or alternative\n(\"non-descriptors\").  Because non-descriptors are used to direct users to\npreferred terms, they are also known as \"lead-in-terminology\".  In standard\nthesaurus practice, non-descriptors are not used to tag resources for indexing\nand retrieval.\n\n\nIn accordance with thesaurus practice, SKOS prescribes that concepts not have\ntwo preferred labels in a given language and recommends that preferred labels\nin a given language be unique within the context of a given concept scheme\n(e.g., that no two concepts share the prefLabel \"lime\"@en).  In accordance with\nthe SKOS specification, it is an error if a concept has a same literal both as\nits preferred label and as an alternative label.\n\n\nIn GACS:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreferred labels MUST be unique for the core languages of GACS.

Scientific\nnames may be expressed as \"Latinate\" (Latin or Latin-like) phrases, such as\n\"Tsuga canadensis\" or \"Picea engelmannii\".  Exceptions include viruses, which\nare translingually named in English, e.g., \"Foot-and-mouth disease virus\".  If\nthe goal of GACS were to provide a definitive database for species or taxons,\nit might follow relevant standards such as Darwin Core, which designates\nscientific names with a special property.  In order to meet the simpler use\ncases of bibliographic indexing, GACS follows the thesaurus paradigm of\nconcepts with preferred and alternate labels.  Insofar as scientific names are\ntranslingual, they are considered in GACS as belonging to no language in\nparticular.  Labels with scientific names are tagged with a code, 'zxx',\ndefined in ISO 639-2 and ISO 639-3 for content that is not specific to any\nlanguage (@cite).\n\n\nIn GACS, the distinction between preferred and alternative labels is largely\northogonal to the distinction between scientific and common names.
