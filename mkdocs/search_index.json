According to ISO 25964-1 5.1.1, each term in the\nthesaurus is required to be unique and only represent one concept. In other\nwords, if the word \"lime\" denotes both a fruit and a mineral it is not allowed\nto label the two separate concepts for lime with the same label (\"lime\") -- the\nlabels must be made unique, perhaps by adding parenthetical qualification\n(\"lime (mineral)\") or by unambiguously expressing the concept so that the\nmeaning is clear (\"lime fruits\").\n\n\nTerms in a thesaurus can be either \"preferred terms\" or \"non-preferred terms\". \n\n\nTerms that are used for subject indexing, \"preferred terms\", are also known as\n\"descriptors\". In the decades-old tradition of information-retrieval thesauri,\nresources are tagged for the purposes of indexing and retrieval using\n\"preferred terms\". The precision of term-based indexing depends on the\nuniqueness of the strings used to encode the terms. In production environments,\nfor example when thesauri are used in complex workflows, it is important that\npreferred terms also remain stable. \n\n\nTerms other than preferred terms are \"non-preferred terms\", or non-descriptors.\nBecause non-descriptors are used to direct users to preferred terms, they are\nalso known as \"lead-in-terminology\".  According to thesaurus standards,\nnon-descriptors may not be used to tag resources for indexing and retrieval.\n\n\nIn SKOS, the distinction between preferred and non-preferred terms is expressed\nwith the properties skos:prefLabel and skos:altLabel.

It was constructed to accommodate \nthe indexing vocabulary of the databases produced by the three organizations but it has features in \ncommon with other knowledge classifications.   CABI published the hierarchical classification in 1999.\n\nThe classification has been adapted for GACS and remains hierarchical multilevel with two-letter codes \nused to designate specific groups within the upper classification.\n\n\nBrief view of upper Classification Scheme applied to GACS:\nTwo-\nLetter\nCode    Classification Heading\nCA  GENERAL \nFA  PHYSICAL SCIENCES \nJA  EARTH SCIENCES \nLA  LIFE SCIENCES \nPA  APPLIED SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY \nWA  SOCIAL SCIENCES AND HUMANITIES \n\n\nEach concept in the GACS is assigned at least one category.  Since the classification is not strict, terms \ncan be placed in more than one category.  In general, the codes for the upper classification are not used \nsince a more specific code is applied.\neg, Concept of \u201cforestry equipment\u201d may be in two categories:\n    SR  Forestry\n    TN  Equipment\n\n\nThe purpose of this document is to give guiding Scope Notes for each category to future maintainers of \nthe GACS vocabulary.  As this work evolves, the documentation can be updated to reflect current \nopinion and guidance.  Examples of Concepts sorted into the classification are given.",
