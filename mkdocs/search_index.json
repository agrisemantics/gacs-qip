According to ISO 25964-1 5.1.1, each term in the\nthesaurus is required to be unique and only represent one concept. In other\nwords, if the word \"lime\" denotes both a fruit and a mineral it is not allowed\nto label the two separate concepts for lime with the same label (\"lime\") -- the\nlabels must be made unique, perhaps by adding parenthetical qualification\n(\"lime (mineral)\") or by unambiguously expressing the concept so that the\nmeaning is clear (\"lime fruits\").\n\n\nTerms in a thesaurus can be either \"preferred terms\" or \"non-preferred terms\". \n\n\nTerms that are used for subject indexing, \"preferred terms\", are also known as\n\"descriptors\". In the decades-old tradition of information-retrieval thesauri,\nresources are tagged for the purposes of indexing and retrieval using\n\"preferred terms\". The precision of term-based indexing depends on the\nuniqueness of the strings used to encode the terms. In production environments,\nfor example when thesauri are used in complex workflows, it is important that\npreferred terms also remain stable. \n\n\nTerms other than preferred terms are \"non-preferred terms\", or non-descriptors.\nBecause non-descriptors are used to direct users to preferred terms, they are\nalso known as \"lead-in-terminology\".  According to thesaurus standards,\nnon-descriptors may not be used to tag resources for indexing and retrieval.\n\n\nIn SKOS, the distinction between preferred and non-preferred terms is expressed\nwith the properties skos:prefLabel and skos:altLabel.

Indexers will propose terms.  NAL sends suggestions to GRIN - sometimes they add it in.  Plantlist is generally in agreement with GRIN.  GRIN more focused on economic plants.  This is a complement to Plant List.  Agree: use both.

From taxonomic point of view, can trust because sources are strong.  They rank things with stars, or mark as 'unresolved'.  Cover over 1 million species names.  Use together with GRIN.\n\n\n\n\nIndex Nominum Genericorum (ING)\n. A compilation of generic names published for organisms.\n\n\n\n\nRESOLVED\n: Authorities for plant genera.  Does not give taxonomic decisions -- not a taxonomic authority -- just gives information about when published, whether validly published.  Useful for homonyms.
