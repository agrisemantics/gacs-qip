            "text": "A concept scheme, GACS is based on \"concepts\" -- abstract entities, or\n\"units of thought\", seen as independent from the natural-language terms used to\nexpress them.  Concepts are identified with URIs, and these URIs are often \nused to tag resources for purposes of indexing and retrieval.\n\n\nAs GACS vocabulary has its origins in three thesauri, it is natural that the\nthesaurus standards concerning concepts and labels along with the SKOS\nReference guidelines are considered. \n\n\nIn thesaurus standards, natural-language \"terms\" are used to express concepts,\nusually in the form of single nouns or noun phrases (e.g., \"habitats\" or\n\"habitat conservation\").   According to ISO 25964-1 5.1.1, each term in the\nthesaurus is required to be unique and only represent one concept. In other\nwords, if the word \"lime\" denotes both a fruit and a mineral it is not allowed\nto label the two separate concepts for lime with the same label (\"lime\") -- the\nlabels must be made unique, perhaps by adding parenthetical qualification\n(\"lime (mineral)\") or by unambiguously expressing the concept so that the\nmeaning is clear (\"lime fruits\").\n\n\nTerms in a thesaurus can be either \"preferred terms\" or \"non-preferred terms\". \n\n\nTerms that are used for subject indexing, \"preferred terms\", are also known as\n\"descriptors\". In the decades-old tradition of information-retrieval thesauri,\nresources are tagged for the purposes of indexing and retrieval using\n\"preferred terms\". The precision of term-based indexing depends on the\nuniqueness of the strings used to encode the terms. In production environments,\nfor example when thesauri are used in complex workflows, it is important that\npreferred terms also remain stable. \n\n\nTerms other than preferred terms are \"non-preferred terms\", or non-descriptors.\nBecause non-descriptors are used to direct users to preferred terms, they are\nalso known as \"lead-in-terminology\".  According to thesaurus standards,\nnon-descriptors may not be used to tag resources for indexing and retrieval.\n\n\nIn SKOS, the distinction between preferred and non-preferred terms is expressed\nwith the properties skos:prefLabel and skos:altLabel.  In accordance with\nthesaurus practice, the SKOS specification prescribes that a concept not have\ntwo preferred labels in a given language and recommends that preferred labels\nin a given language be unique within the context of a given concept scheme\n(e.g., that no two concepts share the prefLabel \"lime\"@en).  In accordance with\nthe SKOS specification, it is an error if a concept has a same literal both as\nits preferred label and as an alternative label.\n\n\nIn GACS (as approved 2016-02-09):\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreferred labels MUST be unique for the core languages of GACS. That \n   is, one concept MUST NOT have the same preferred label as another \n   concept in the same (core) language.\n   Note: \"unique\" is case insensitive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreferred labels SHOULD be unique for the other (non-core) languages \n   of GACS. That is, one concept SHOULD NOT have the same preferred label as \n   another concept in the same (non-core) language.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn core languages, an alternate label MUST NOT be identical to a \n   preferred label of another concept.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn other (non-core) languages, an alternate label SHOULD NOT be \n   identical to a preferred label of another concept.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlternate labels MUST be unique for the core languages of GACS. That \n   is, one concept MUST NOT have the same alternate label as another \n   concept in the same (core) language.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlternate labels SHOULD be unique for the other (non-core) languages \n   of GACS. That is, one concept SHOULD NOT have the same alternate label as \n   another concept in the same (non-core) language.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGiven sufficient resources for translation, labels in all languages should\nideally follow the restrictions for English, Spanish, and scientific names.",

Scientific\nnames may be expressed as \"Latinate\" (Latin or Latin-like) phrases, such as\n\"Tsuga canadensis\" or \"Picea engelmannii\".  Exceptions include viruses, which\nare translingually named in English, e.g., \"Foot-and-mouth disease virus\".  If\nthe goal of GACS were to provide a definitive database for species or taxons,\nit might follow relevant standards such as Darwin Core, which designates\nscientific names with a special property.  In order to meet the simpler use\ncases of bibliographic indexing, GACS follows the thesaurus paradigm of\nconcepts with preferred and alternate labels.  Insofar as scientific names are\ntranslingual, they are considered in GACS as belonging to no language in\nparticular.  Labels with scientific names are tagged with a code, 'zxx',\ndefined in ISO 639-2 and ISO 639-3 for content that is not specific to any\nlanguage (@cite).\n\n\nIn GACS, the distinction between preferred and alternative labels is largely\northogonal to the distinction between scientific and common names.
