In GACS:

* Each concept in GACS is identified with a unique URI.
* Each concept has at least one preferred label, either tagged by language or
  designated as a scientific name.
* Each concept has only one preferred label per language.  (Different language
  tags for a given language, such as `en-us` and `en-gb`, designate separate
  languages.)
* All labels in a given language -- preferred, alternative, or designated
  as scientific name -- are unique strings.
* Alternative labels are optional; hidden labels, though part of SKOS, are not used.
