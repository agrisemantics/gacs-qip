This website documents the principles and guidelines used to maintain the
Global Agricultural Concept Scheme (GACS).  It aims at providing enough
explanation and historical context to convey the rationale for the design
principles underlying GACS.  It is intended to serve as a living document that
will be amended as GACS evolves.  

GACS is expressed as a SKOS concept scheme, so readers will benefit from a
basic understanding of [Simple Knowledge Organization Scheme
(SKOS)](http://www.w3.org/TR/skos-primer/).
