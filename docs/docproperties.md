#### Scope notes

[ISO 25964, p8, scope note: "note that defines or clarifies the
semantic boundiaries of a concept as it is used in the structured vocabulary".
Goes on to note: "A term used to label a concept can have several meanings in
normal usage.  A scope note is used to restrict the concept to only one of
those meanings, and where necessary refers to other concepts that are included
or excluded from the scope of the concept being clarified." [Scope Notes: when
needed.  Expunge scope notes from NAL, FAO and CAB since the reference to "use
other term" is likely to only apply to that particular thesaurus.  The scope
note would need to apply to GACS structures and prefLabels.  Need to assure
quality of scope notes pointing to prefLabels of GACS concepts.]

#### History notes

[History notes: What sort of information to record in a note.
Can we assume that input date, modification date are coded in editorial
platform, so this information should not be in history note?]
