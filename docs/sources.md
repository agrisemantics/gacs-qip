### Taxonomic authorities  

The list is divided by subject (using h3 for headings).  More than one
authority per subject area may be listed.  List of authorities for this DRAFT
is considering taxonomic authorities, but other authorities (such as for
pesticides, enzymes, medical, etc.) may be listed.

See also [Taxonomic sources used in CAB Thesaurus](https://github.com/tombaker/gacswg/blob/master/phase2/CABT%20Taxonomy%20Sources.docx?raw=true)

#### Plant Taxonomy

* __Angiosperm Phylogeny Group__ 2009. An update of the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group classification for the orders and families of flowering plants: APG III. Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society, 161:105-121.  [http://www.mobot.org/MOBOT/research/APweb/](http://www.mobot.org/MOBOT/research/APweb/) - Agreed to use.

* [Germplasm Resources Information Network (GRIN)](http://www.ars-grin.gov/cgi-bin/npgs/html/queries.pl?language=en )

__RESOLVED__: Many things not in GRIN that one will find in the plant list.  Indexers will propose terms.  NAL sends suggestions to GRIN - sometimes they add it in.  Plantlist is generally in agreement with GRIN.  GRIN more focused on economic plants.  This is a complement to Plant List.  Agree: use both.  If they do not agree, there is a reason (e.g., one is out of date, or controversial) - requires more work (e.g., email to specialists).

* [The International Plant Names Index (IPNI)](http://www.ipni.org/index.html)

__RESOLVED__: One of the sources is Kew Botanical Gardens - does various databases.  From taxonomic point of view, can trust because sources are strong.  They rank things with stars, or mark as 'unresolved'.  Cover over 1 million species names.  Use together with GRIN.

* [Index Nominum Genericorum (ING)](http://botany.si.edu/ing/). A compilation of generic names published for organisms.

__RESOLVED__: Authorities for plant genera.  Does not give taxonomic decisions -- not a taxonomic authority -- just gives information about when published, whether validly published.  Useful for homonyms.  Will not say which is right name, but say whether a name is valid or not.  In GACS, would use rarely.

* [Names in Current Use - Genera](http://www.bgbm.fu-berlin.de/iapt/ncu/genera/NCUGQuery.htm)
Only genus. 

__RESOLVED__: Plant list is like this.  Not used in GACS.
 
#### Algae

* AlgaeBase - [http://www.algaebase.org/](http://www.algaebase.org/)

__RESOLVED__: This is the one real resource - fully up-to-date.  Primary source for GACS w.r.t. algae.

#### Bacteria

* Bergey's Manual of Systematic Bacteriology, 2nd Edition. 
    * Volume 1: The Archaea and the deeply branching and phototrophic Bacteria. 
    * Volume 2: The Proteobacteria. 
    * Volume 3: The Firmicutes. 
    * Volume 4:  The Bacteroidetes, Spirochaetes, Tenericutes (Mollicutes),
      Acidobacteria, Fibrobacteres, Fusobacteria, Dictyoglomi,
      Gemmatimonadetes, Lentisphaerae, Verrucomicrobia, Chlamydiae, and
      Planctomycetes
    * Volume 5: The Actinobacteria

__RESOLVED__: Instead of Bergey's (always been the Bible), but now surpassed by LPSN (List of Prokaryotic names with Standing in Nomenclature LPSN) and DSMZ:

* LPSN [List of Prokaryotic names with Standing in Nomenclature LPSN (formerly
List of Bacterial names with Standing in Nomenclature
LBSN)](http://www.bacterio.cict.fr/) - CABT recommends.  Lots of extra information here to make decisions about names.  Why a name is used or not.  LPSN is a database of bacterial names and prokaryotes names. It
includes a comprehensive classification and taxonomy.  Only 5% of bacteria have names, but LPSN tries to keep things up-to-date.  Started in France, but international.  Working together with Bergey's to make sure they have the same.

* DSMZ: [Prokaryotic Nomenclature Up-to-date](https://www.dsmz.de/bacterial-diversity/prokaryotic-nomenclature-up-to-date.html)

### Animals

#### Reptiles

* [THE REPTILE DATABASE](http://www.reptile-database.org/) - fully up-to-date.  The place.
    * [Checklist of Chelonians of the World](http://www.cnah.org/pdf_files/851.pdf) - part of Reptile database.

##### Fishbase

* Link?

__RESOLVED__: The one best place to go for anything about fish.  Feeds into Worms, which is a broader database.  Fishwise is a rival, but more out-of-date (only for supplementary information).

* [WoRMS - MarineSpecies.org](http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=search) - everything marine.
    * all marine stuff
    * not freshwater
    * [Rotifera.pdf (application/pdf Object)](http://fada.biodiversity.be/CheckLists/Rotifera.pdf)
    * [MarBEF](http://www.marbef.org/data/aphia.php?p=search)
    * Incorporates FishBase (there are mirror site throughout the world, here is the link to the US site) [http://www.fishbase.us/](http://www.fishbase.us/) - all fish, including fishbase.

* [Fishwise - Database of World Fishes](http://www.fishwise.co.za/)

> A comprehensive database of world FISHES and FISH FACTS. Contains over
> 96 500 scientific names of Fish Species and GenusSpecies. Over 32 000
> pictures and photographs. Information about fish taxonomy and
> scientific classification of fresh and saltwater fish.

#### Fungi

* [Index Fungorum](http://www.indexfungorum.org/names/names.asp)

__RESOLVED__: GACS can rely on this.  Generally sufficient for GACS needs; CABT starts here.  Index started in CABI.  Other sources:

* [MycoBank](http://www.mycobank.org/).  GACS also uses. Sometimes does not agree with Index Fungorum.

* For specialist, medical purposes, can use: [Dr. Fungus](http://www.doctorfungus.org/).  Not very relevant to GACS.

* Hibbett, D.S., et al. 2007. "A higher level phylogenetic classification of the Fungi". Mycol. Res. 111 (5): 509-547. [http://www.umich.edu/~mycology/resources/Publications/Hibbett-et-al.-2007.pdf](http://www.umich.edu/~mycology/resources/Publications/Hibbett-et-al.-2007.pdf) - we think this is in alignment with Index Fungorum.  NAL used it in 2007.  Good for upper-level classification of fungi (where there are alot of differences).  

* Species Fungorum - [http://www.speciesfungorum.org/Names/Names.asp](http://www.speciesfungorum.org/Names/Names.asp) - more synonyms - fits with Index Fungorum - not a separate resource.

* [LIAS names – A Database with Names of Lichens, Lichenicolous Fungi and Non-Lichenized Ascomycetes](http://liasnames.lias.net/)

__RESOLVED__: GACS sees no need for lichen authority for now.

#### Enzymes

* [ExPASy - ENZYME](http://enzyme.expasy.org/) - Swiss International Union of... Biochemistry - can rely on this to have correct information.  On their webpage, link out to more specialize:
    * [Enzyme Database - BRENDA](http://www.brenda-enzymes.org/index.php) - The Comprehensive Enzyme Information System
    * KEGG (genes and genomes)
    * International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Nomenclature Committee. Enzyme nomenclature 1992. San Diego: Academic Press, 1992. [http://www.chem.qmul.ac.uk/iubmb/enzyme/search.html](http://www.chem.qmul.ac.uk/iubmb/enzyme/search.html)

__RESOLVED__: Several enzyme databases with differing content.  The International Union is the authority.  They make many databases.  For GACS purposes, use ExPASy.

#### Chemical

* [Compendium of Pesticide Common Names](http://www.alanwood.net/pesticides/) Nomenclature information for over 1700 active ingredients of pesticides, plus classified lists of acaricides, fungicides, herbicides, insecticides, nematicides and plant growth regulators.  Includes the systematic name, molecular formula, structural formula and CAS Registry Number for each common name.

__RESOLVED__: This is fully up-to-date.  GACS uses this.

##### Chemicals in general

__ISSUE__: Need to have GACS philosophy on chemicals: classified by chemical
structure (sometimes needs to fit into several hierarchies)?  Functional use?
Or both?  Chemicals by pharmacological action?

__RESOLVED__: Problem with chemicals: no standard way of rendering chemical
names.  Different viewpoints.   And some sources are not freely available.  Use
the following:

* [ChemIDPlus](http://chem2.sis.nlm.nih.gov/chemidplus/chemidlite.jsp) - CABI uses this alot.  Medical focus.  To give decision on what to use.  Uses a hierarchy.  GACS prefers this.  

* [MeSH supplementary concept data](http://www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/MBrowser.html) - useful for chemicals and drugs.

The following may be consulted:

* [Chemfinder](http://chemfinder.cambridgesoft.com/)

* [NIST Chemistry WebBook](http://webbook.nist.gov/chemistry/)

* [Common Chemistry - Search Chemical Names and CAS Registry Numbers](http://www.commonchemistry.org/index.aspx)

* [ChemSpider | The free chemical database](http://www.chemspider.com/) ChemSpider is a free chemical structure database providing fast access to over 26 million structures, properties and associated information.  Chemicals used in manufacturing.  Not very relevant to GACS.

* [DrugBank](http://www.drugbank.ca/) - probably covered by MeSH, but focused more on drug industry - could be useful for experimental drugs, developments.  Drug target information.

#### Geographical Names

* [Getty Thesaurus of Geographic Names](https://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/tgn/)
    * On 2015-03-01, https://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/tgn/about.html : "TGN will be released as LOD later in 2014."
    * Will it be an option to adopt TGN for places after it is openly released, and stop maintaining the current places?
    * Open question: How much overlap between AGROVOC/NALT/CABT and TGN?

__ISSUE__: Depends how deep GACS wants to go.  Top level is covered by UN.  World Fact Book (was: CIA Fact Book).  

__RESOLVED__: No clear resolution, but not a big issue for GACS at present.

##### Viruses

* [Listing in Taxonomic Order - Index to ICTV Species Lists](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ICTVdb/Ictv/fr-fst-g.htm) - not reliable - has disclaimer - not to use as taxonomic database.

* [ICTVdb Index of Viruses](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ICTVdb/Ictv/ICTVindex.htm)

* [ICTV Home](http://www.ictvonline.org/)

* [Search ICTVdB](http://www.ictvdb.rothamsted.ac.uk/Ictv/ICTVdBsearch.htm)

* [Description of Plant Viruses](http://www.dpvweb.net/index.php) International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) "Virus Taxonomy: Classification and nomenclature of viruses" - http://www.ictvonline.org/ (from Tom's notes)

__RESOLVED__: ICTV is the place

#### Other

* Catalogue of life - http://www.catalogueoflife.org/ - not checked properly - aggregates names.  Not up-to-date.   GACS does not use.

* Ontologies in Wheat Data Research Domain - http://is.gd/ZB3fEl  - expands to https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MWSSarm2r85Wf2mcnpOrMTidevFw0gtuYw2_prNDzlE/edit (suggested by Johannes) - very detailed, beyond what is needed for GACS.
