[What GACS is.  GACS as a 'concept scheme'.  Origins in three thesauri. How
'concept scheme' differs (or not!) from 'thesaurus'.  Use of standards in its
construction, such as ISO 25964.  Use of SKOS in its expression.  Concepts
(identified with unique URIs) versus labels (terms).  Use of concept URIs in
Linked Data.  Use of preferred labels (unique terms) for indexing in retrieval
systems.  Multilinguality.]

Uses of GACS

* Controlled set of concepts (controlled vocabulary?) for the subject indexing
  of agricultural research projects, agricultural literature, and other
  agricultural materials.  Use in Linked Data: when tagged with GACS URIs and
  indexed by search engines, resources discoverable on global scale.  

* "Smart searching": provides a means of enhancing recall and precision for the
  searcher without the searcher's knowledge of the thesaurus.  Hierarchy can be
  used to make searches more inclusive: an inclusive search is where terms
  narrower than the search terms are added to queries.  Searches may also be
  enhanced by use of related concepts.  

* Support to automated indexing systems.

* Multilinguality: terminology across languages.
