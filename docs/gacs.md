[What GACS is.  GACS as a 'concept scheme'.  Origins in three thesauri. How
'concept scheme' differs (or not!) from 'thesaurus'.  Use of standards in its
construction, such as ISO 25964.  Use of SKOS in its expression.  Concepts
(identified with unique URIs) versus labels (terms).  Use of concept URIs in
Linked Data.  Use of preferred labels (unique terms) for indexing in retrieval
systems.  Multilinguality.]

### Scope (Subject coverage)

[Rough characterization of subject coverage, perhaps with graphics.]

[Semantic types (list).  Rationale for limited use of semantic types.]

[Classification scheme and its rationale.  Origins in UAT.  Its relation
to semantic types.]

[Something about UAT motivation: Categories originally constructed as entry
points into thesaurus terms.  "Discipline-oriented"?  Intended to show breadth
of topic coverage?  Comment about specificity of categories, user-friendliness.
For Web presentation (or paper-based)?]

[ISO 25964, p2, defines classification: "activity involving the components of
grouping similar and related things together, separating dissimilar or
unrelated things, and arranging the resulting groups in a logical and helpful
sequence".]
