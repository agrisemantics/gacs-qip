### Scope (Subject coverage)

[Rough characterization of subject coverage, perhaps with graphics.]

[Semantic types (list).  Rationale for limited use of semantic types.]

[Classification scheme and its rationale.  Origins in UAT.  Its relation
to semantic types.]

[Something about UAT motivation: Categories originally constructed as entry
points into thesaurus terms.  "Discipline-oriented"?  Intended to show breadth
of topic coverage?  Comment about specificity of categories, user-friendliness.
For Web presentation (or paper-based)?]

[ISO 25964, p2, defines classification: "activity involving the components of
grouping similar and related things together, separating dissimilar or
unrelated things, and arranging the resulting groups in a logical and helpful
sequence".]
