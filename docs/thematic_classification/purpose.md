Scope Notes for GACS Thematic Classification
First draft September 11, 2017

Purpose of the GACS Thematic Classification
•	To enable users of GACS to view terms by subject areas or disciplines
•	To collect terms in a subject area that may be of interest to specialists which are 
separated in the strict Hierarchical arrangement of GACS

The classification scheme used was derived from the Unified Agriculture Thesaurus Project UAT, which 
was a joint project between CABI, NAL and FAO concluded in 1999.   It was constructed to accommodate 
the indexing vocabulary of the databases produced by the three organizations but it has features in 
common with other knowledge classifications.   CABI published the hierarchical classification in 1999.  
The classification has been adapted for GACS and remains hierarchical multilevel with two-letter codes 
used to designate specific groups within the upper classification.

Brief view of upper Classification Scheme applied to GACS:
Two-
Letter
Code	Classification Heading
CA 	GENERAL 
FA 	PHYSICAL SCIENCES 
JA 	EARTH SCIENCES 
LA 	LIFE SCIENCES 
PA 	APPLIED SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY 
WA 	SOCIAL SCIENCES AND HUMANITIES 

Each concept in the GACS is assigned at least one category.  Since the classification is not strict, terms 
can be placed in more than one category.  In general, the codes for the upper classification are not used 
since a more specific code is applied.
eg,	Concept of “forestry equipment” may be in two categories:
	SR 	Forestry
	TN	Equipment

The purpose of this document is to give guiding Scope Notes for each category to future maintainers of 
the GACS vocabulary.  As this work evolves, the documentation can be updated to reflect current 
opinion and guidance.  Examples of Concepts sorted into the classification are given.
