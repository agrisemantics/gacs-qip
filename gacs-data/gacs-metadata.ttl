  dc:description """The Global Agricultural Concept Scheme (GACS) is a hub for
  concepts related to agriculture, in multiple languages, for use in Linked
  Data. The idea for GACS emerged out of discussions at the World Congress of
  IAALD, the International Association of Agricultural Information Specialists,
  in July 2013. The Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations
  (FAO), CAB International (CABI), and the National Agricultural Library of the
  USA (NAL) agreed in October 2013 to explore the feasibility of developing a
  shared concept scheme by integrating their three thesauri: the AGROVOC
  Concept Scheme, the CAB Thesaurus (CABT), and NAL Thesaurus (NALT). In the
  GACS vision, the integration of these three thesauri is but the first step
  towards the realization of a hub that links to and from the concept schemes
  beyond the initial three, and in multiple language areas."""@en ;
