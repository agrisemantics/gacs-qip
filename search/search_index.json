As a SKOS concept scheme, GACS\nidentifies its concepts with Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) for use in\nLinked Data.  GACS Beta 3.1, published in May 2016 with 15,000 concepts and\n350,000 terms (labels) in over 25 languages, will soon be superseded by \nGACS\n4.0\n, the result of\na recent \nGACS Quality Improvement Project\n.\n\n\nCreated since 2014 on the initiative of three organizations, the Food and\nAgriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the Centre for\nAgriculture and Biosciences International (CABI), and the USDA National\nAgricultural Library (NAL), GACS was formed at the intersection of\nmost-frequently-used concepts from their three respective thesauri -- the\n\nAGROVOC Concept Scheme\n, \nCAB\nThesaurus\n, and the \nNAL\nThesaurus\n, for which GACS provides a mapping\nhub.\n\n\nGACS is seen as an important step towards linking and integrating agricultural\ndata of all types to address the long-term challenge of global food security.\nThe GACS community of maintenance organizations is growing.

In GACS, definitions are \"nice to have\", but\nsemantic relations are essential.  For maintainability, the set of semantic\nrelations used in GACS has been kept as simple and obvious as possible.\n\n\nBroader, narrower, and related concepts\n\n\nGACS concepts are linked among themselves with \nrelated\n, \nbroader\n, and\n\nnarrower\n relations as defined in SKOS, which are themselves based on standard\nthesaurus relations (\nRT\n, \nBT\n, and \nNT\n).  \nBroader\n and \nnarrower\n do not\nformally distinguish between \"is a\" and \"part of\" relations.

Thematic categories allow users to view concepts by subject\narea or discipline and present specialists with concepts of interest in their \nfields.\n\n\nIn creating GACS, the GACS Working Group re-used a classification scheme\ndeveloped by CABI, FAO, and NAL in the 1990s for a joint project, the Unified\nAgriculture Thesaurus (UAT).  A version of CABT using the classification scheme\nwas published in 1999 as the CAB Classified Thesaurus in a single edition.  The\n1999 edition was found to cover over 80% of the concepts in GACS, and the\nremaining 20% of concepts were classified manually.  \n\n\nThe classification scheme, which is based primarily on the CAB Classified\nThesaurus, is specific to GACS and may be pruned or expanded in accordance with\nGACS requirements.\n\n\nThe classification scheme may be browsed under the \nGroups tab of the Skosmos\nwebsite\n.  A\nlisting of the \nfull classification\nscheme\n\nfor printout. \n\n\nHeadings in the classification scheme are designated with two-letter codes.\nIn addition, each heading is identified with a URI in the GACS namespace, \nsuch as \nhttp://id.agrisemantics.org/gacs/G_HW\n\nfor \nHW organic compounds\n.\n\n\nThe upper level has five categories:\n\n\n    Code    Classification Heading \n    CA      GENERAL \n    FA      PHYSICAL SCIENCES \n    JA      EARTH SCIENCES \n    LA      LIFE SCIENCES \n    PA      APPLIED SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY \n    WA      SOCIAL SCIENCES AND HUMANITIES\n\n\n\nThe five categories in the top-level classification serve to cluster the\ncategories of the lower levels and are not themselves intended to be used for\nindexing.  The second level of the hierarchy has 30 categories, the third 91,\nand the fourth 14, with four categories on a fifth level.  \nScope\nnotes\n\nfor the classification prepared by Lori Finch include notes on how lesser-used\ncategories might be combined or deleted.\n\n\nEach concept in GACS is assigned at least one category.  The classification is\nnot strict, and terms can be placed in more than one category.",

            "text": "ISO 25964 defines a scope note as a \"note that defines or clarifies the\nsemantic boundiaries of a concept as it is used in the structured vocabulary.\n...  A term used to label a concept can have several meanings in normal usage.\nA scope note is used to restrict the concept to only one of those meanings, and\nwhere necessary refers to other concepts that are included or excluded from the\nscope of the concept being clarified.\" \n\n\nGACS includes some scope notes inherited from AGROVOC, CABT, and NALT.  It was\nsuggested that these inherited note be dropped from GACS because their \"use\nother term\" references typically refer only to terms in AGROVOC, CABT, and\nNALT, whereas they should refer to other terms in GACS.  For now, however, the \nnotes have been retained for their possible future revision.",
